        <center><h1>Welcome to Kaisaan's Website!</h1></center>

        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>Hello there I'm Kaisaan Siddiqui, just another person on the internet. On this website I plan on talking about my passions and achievements.</p>  
        <h2>Academics</h2>
            <p>After graduating highschool with both an Ontario Second School Diploma (OSSD) and an Internation Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, I am currently enrolled to have a BSc in Computer Science at York University.</p>
            <h3>University</h3>
                <p>I am currently set to graduate in 2025 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science at York University. At York, I am currently a member of the Yama Anime and Manga Association (YAMA).</p>
            <h3>Highschool</h3>
                <p>At highschool I was in the Internation Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) and was a part of various clubs. I was the leader of my School's Improv Club for two years. I was also the founder of president of my high school's Anime Club for three years. During this time I had made a small group of close friends. We talk with each other often on Discord and even occastionally meet up and play games.</p>
            <h3>Elementary</h3>
                <p>While I moved cities before the start of Grade 5, I had scored high enough in the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test (CCAT) in Grade 4 to be considered a "Gifted Student". From Grades 5 through 8 I was a part of the In-School Enhanced Learning Program (ISELP). It was through this program that I met some of my close friends. Besides having extra work during school, I was able to participate in various events thanks to ISELP. One of these events included the <a href="https://www.thelearningpartnership.ca/programs/investigate-invent-innovate"><i>Investigate! Invent! Innovate!</i> (I3)</a> Event in Grade 6.</p>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>Video Games have been a very large part about my life. With my first console being a Nintendo DSi XL, I have grown up with Nintendo systems. While I have played a lot of games throughout the years, I have many games that I have <i>not</i> played yet. You can see my full gaming backlog Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljYxrFMEG2iYl3pFuay-poqy8-6tQXxLb3wWhXZz0Ls/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> (commenting is enabled so feel free to add any more suggestions).</p>
            <h3>Mario</h3>
                <p>The Super Mario series is what introduced me into videogaming. With the first game that I recall playing was <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> on my cousin's DSi. In the present day I have played pretty much every mainline Mario game. Some of my favourites include <i>Super Mario Galaxy 2</i>, <i>Super Mario 64 DS</i>, and <i>New Super Luigi U</i>.</p>
            <h3>Mega Man</h3>
                <p>The Mega Man series is something that I only got into very recently. It started when my friend suggested I play through all the Mega Man games that were written in my backlog. Sometime in June of 2020, I played through about 34 Mega Man games within the span of 4 weeks. After that Mega Marathon, I had moved on to other franchises. Currently, I have pretty much played every single game in the main timeline (Classic, X, Zero, ZX, Legends) except for <i>Mega Man X Command Mission</i> and <i>The Misadvantures of Tron Bonne</i>. I will get to the Battle Network and Star Force games soon&trade;. My favourtie Mega Man games are the <i>Mega Man Zero</i> series. The graphics, music, story, and gameplay all com together to make a really beautiful four part series about Zero and his reawakening to fight for everlasting peace.<br>
                My favourite part of Mega Man is defintely the music (just like with all videogames I play), though I also enjoy the gameplay a lot. I love sharing my passion for Mega Man through various ways. For example, I have made this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JgxUnDyHX_vdvqDs0jmtJ6ypNwKcwzOvcIwNdjCpUGk/edit?usp=sharing">presentation that introducing newcomers to Mega Man</a>. I created and presented this slideshow for YAMA's powerpoint night in their Discord server.<br>
                I also have been researching information for multiple Mega Man iceberg images. I plan on creating analysis videos for my Youtube channel. Since there is a lot of information to research, I would appreciate any contributions from others. You can find my research Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bIRYDRNaMYKEAmgVlkSx3GJYX9kCTNNDZ1WbICMsSo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Sonic</h3>
                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a very interesting series with how Sega has handled its Mascot's games. Despite this, I have played most of the games in Sonic's series. Some of my favourite titles are the <i>Sonic Rush</i> duology and the DS version of <i>Sonic Colors</i>.</p>
            <h3>Castlevania</h3>
                <p>The Castlevania series is another series that I only recently got into and have been enjoying a lot. Thanks to a friend that spent over half an hour detailing which games to play and which to avoid, I had the motivation to play through the series. I have adapted their list into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPP4GFr5WB_y4EeafY1CouzN_ldw6j-jso75c_J4yyk/edit?usp=sharing">Goole Doc</a> that also includes a list of optional patches to get to improve the experience. One of my favourite Castlevania games is <i>Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth</i>.</p>
            <h3>Other</h3>
                Besides all these singleplayer games I have talked about above, I occasionally play mutliplayer games. One game that I have recently got into was <i>100% Orange Juice</i>, a board game that plays similar to Mario Party but makes use of cards and turn-based battles. I also occasionally play Minecraft, Fortnite, Roblox, and Terraria. I also have a plethora of games that I've collected on Steam through free sales.
