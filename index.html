        <center><h1>Welcome to Kaisaan's Website!</h1></center>
        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
            <p>I'm Kaisaan Siddiqui. An apsiring programmer and a pro gamer. While I'm not doing schoolwork, I'm usually gaming in my discord server.<br></p>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>I'm a pretty avid gamer. I mainly like playing Super Mario&reg; games. Besides Mario, I've been playing all the Mega Man games recently. So far, I have played...<br>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Mega Man 1 through 11</li> 
                <li>The Wily Wars: Wily Tower</li>
                <li>Rockman &amp; Forte</li>
                <li>Rockman World 1 through 5</li>
                <li>Mega Man X through X8</li>
                <li>Mega Man Xtreme 1 and Xtreme 2</li>
                <li>Mega Man Zero through Zero 4</li></ul>
            ...and now have started Mega Man ZX (and plan on playing ZX Advent).<br> 
            I have a pretty large gaming backlog, you can find a list of it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljYxrFMEG2iYl3pFuay-poqy8-6tQXxLb3wWhXZz0Ls/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Commenting is enabled on that Google Doc if you have any game recommendations.<br></p>
        <h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Along with gaming, I have very interesting in modding my video game consoles. My main interest is modding my Nintendo DSi XL. I am actually moderator of the <a href="https://discord.gg/yD3spjv">DS(i) Mode Hacking Server</a>. I've also been learning programming languages (outside of school), mainly C++. My plan is to make my own games one day and also make a career out of computer programming.<br></p>
        <h3>School and Academics</h3>
            <p>I'm about to enter my Senior year of highschool. I'm also an IB student. I've taken SL Math (I have a level 6), SL French (I have a level 5), SL Physics, HL English, HL Chemistry, and HL History. I've also founded the Anime Club at my school with my friends for fun.<br></p>
