<h1>Digital Devil Story - Rebirth of the Goddess</h1>

<p>I'm making this page to document all the info I can find for <em>Digital Devil Story - Rebirth of the Goddess</em> by Telenet.</p>

<h2>About The Game</h2>
<p><em>Digital Devil Story - Rebirth of the Goddess</em> (The subtitle is usually left untranslated as <em>Megami Tensei</em>) is a videogame by Telenet based off of the novel of the same name by Aya Nishitani. This game is different from the one that Atlus made (and eventually made a sequel to and spawned their flagship franchise) where this one was developed by Telenet Japan (also called Nihon Telenet). Compared to Atlus' first-person dungeon crawler RPG, Telenet went for a top-down dungeon action game. This game is commonly compared to Atari's <em>Gauntlet</em> released two years earlier but to compare it to a game I have actually played, the game is a lot like <em>Jack Bros.</em></p>
