        <h2>Academics</h2>
            <p>After graduating highschool with both an Ontario Second School Diploma (OSSD) and an Internation Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, I am currently enrolled to have a BSc in Computer Science at York University.</p>
            <h3>University</h3>
                <p>I am currently set to graduate in 2025 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science at York University. At York, I am currently a member of the Yama Anime and Manga Association (YAMA).</p>
            <h3>Highschool</h3>
                <p>At highschool I was in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) and was a part of various clubs. I was the leader of my School's Improv Club for two years. I was also the founder and president of my high school's Anime Club for three years. During this time I made a small group of close friends. We talk with each other often on Discord and even occasionally meet up and play games.</p>
            <h3>Elementary</h3>
                <p>While I moved cities before the start of Grade 5, I had scored high enough in the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test (CCAT) in Grade 4 to be considered a "Gifted Student". From Grades 5 through 8 I was a part of the In-School Enhanced Learning Program (ISELP). It was through this program that I met some of my close friends. Besides having extra work during school, I was able to participate in various events thanks to ISELP. One of these events included the <a href="https://www.thelearningpartnership.ca/programs/investigate-invent-innovate" target="_blank"><i>Investigate! Invent! Innovate!</i> (I3)</a> Event in Grade 6.</p>
